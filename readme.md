#SQL code warmup

This is a warmup exercise for the class to review the basics of SQL

##Getting started

- clone this repository
- cd into to directory
- ls make sure you see the file videogames.sql
- psql
- \i videogames.sql to run the file videogames.sql

##instructions

You will write your code between the `--` lines for each echo that is given.

To test your code, each time, run `\i videogames.sql` in the psql part of the terminal either in VSCode or in your iTerm. Not both. Make sure your Postgres app is running.

Remember, each time that you run the above command you are recreating the database and the tables and re-running all the queries.

If you feel your terminal is too crowded when testing, feel free to comment out the previous problems.
